# Resend Email Service Setup

## Overview

This website uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for sending invoice emails to customers. Resend is a modern email API that provides reliable email delivery.

## Current Configuration

- **API Key**: Currently using a hardcoded key (should be moved to environment variables)
- **From Email**: `noreply@serenespaces.com` (you'll need to verify this domain)
- **Reply-To**: `loveserenespaces@gmail.com`

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Resend Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Other environment variables...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
```

### 2. Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key and add it to your `.env.local` file

### 3. Verify Your Domain (Recommended)

To send emails from `noreply@serenespaces.com` instead of the default Resend domain:

1. In your Resend dashboard, go to Domains
2. Add your domain (`serenespaces.com`)
3. Follow the DNS verification steps
4. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)

### 4. Test Email Sending

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/admin/invoices/new`
3. Fill out an invoice with a valid email address
4. Click "ðŸ“§ Send Invoice"
5. Check the email was received
