# Invoice Functionality Setup Guide

## What I've Fixed

I've identified and fixed the following issues with your invoice system:

1. **"Save as Draft" button** - Now functional and saves invoices to memory
2. **"Create Invoice" button** - Now properly creates and saves invoices
3. **Invoice creation flow** - Complete working system that creates invoices and redirects to view page
4. **API routes** - All invoice-related API endpoints now work without requiring database setup

## Current Status

The invoice system is now working with **in-memory storage** (no database required) so you can test all functionality immediately.

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/admin/invoices/new`

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Fill out the invoice form
   - Click "Save as Draft" - should save and redirect to invoice view
   - Click "Create Invoice" - should create and redirect to invoice view
   - Click "ðŸ“§ Send Invoice" - should send email (if RESEND_API_KEY is configured)

## What Works Now

âœ… **Save as Draft** - Saves invoice and redirects to view page  
âœ… **Create Invoice** - Creates invoice and redirects to view page  
âœ… **Send Invoice** - Sends email via Resend API  
âœ… **Invoice List** - Shows all created invoices  
âœ… **Invoice View** - Displays invoice details  
âœ… **Invoice Edit** - Links to edit page  
âœ… **Invoice Delete** - Removes invoices  
âœ… **Status Updates** - Change invoice status

## For Production Use

To use this with a real database instead of in-memory storage:

1. **Set up a PostgreSQL database** (Vercel Postgres, Neon, etc.)
2. **Create a `.env.local` file:**
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"
   ```
3. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
4. **The system will automatically switch to database storage**

## Email Configuration (Optional)

To enable email sending:

1. **Get a Resend API key** from [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. **Add to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## Quick Test

1. Go to `/admin/invoices/new`
2. Fill out customer info and add some items
3. Click "Save as Draft" or "Create Invoice"
4. You should be redirected to the invoice view page
5. The invoice should appear in the invoice list at `/admin/invoices`

## Troubleshooting

- **If you see "Failed to create invoice"** - Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- **If emails aren't sending** - Make sure RESEND_API_KEY is set in your environment
- **If the page doesn't load** - Make sure the development server is running

The invoice system is now fully functional and ready for testing!
